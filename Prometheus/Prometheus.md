### **Prometheus Architecture**
Prometheus consists of multiple components that work together to provide metrics collection, storage, and query capabilities. Here are its key components:

1. **Prometheus Server**:
   - **Core Component**: Responsible for scraping and storing metrics.
   - **Functions**:
     - Fetches metrics by querying configured targets via HTTP endpoints (using the pull model).
     - Stores the scraped metrics in a time-series database.
     - Handles queries from users via PromQL (Prometheus Query Language).

2. **Pushgateway**:
   - Used for services that cannot be scraped directly.
   - Acts as an intermediary where applications can push metrics, which Prometheus then pulls.

3. **Alertmanager**:
   - Handles alerts generated by Prometheus based on preconfigured rules.
   - Supports deduplication, grouping, routing, and notification through various channels like email, Slack, or PagerDuty.

4. **Exporters**:
   - Standalone services that expose metrics in a format Prometheus can scrape.
   - Examples include **Node Exporter** (system metrics), **Blackbox Exporter** (endpoint testing), and application-specific exporters like for databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

5. **PromQL**:
   - A query language specifically designed to query and aggregate metrics stored in Prometheus.
   - Example:
     ```promql
     rate(http_requests_total[5m])
     ```

6. **Storage**:
   - Stores metrics as time-series data (a combination of metric name, timestamp, and value).
   - Data is stored in a highly efficient custom database format optimized for time-series data.

7. **Service Discovery**:
   - Automatically discovers targets to monitor.
   - Supports static configurations as well as dynamic discovery using integrations with platforms like Kubernetes, AWS, GCP, and Consul.

8. **Visualization**:
   - Exposes metrics via a built-in web interface.
   - Often used in conjunction with Grafana for advanced visualization and dashboarding.

### **How Prometheus Works Internally**

1. **Metric Scraping (Pull Model)**:
   - Prometheus periodically scrapes metrics from configured targets via HTTP.
   - Targets expose metrics in a standard format at an endpoint (usually `/metrics`).

2. **Time-Series Data Storage**:
   - Metrics are stored as time-series (a series of timestamped values per metric).
   - Prometheus uses a local storage engine (based on **levelDB** or **TSDB**) to manage this data efficiently.
   - Older metrics can be archived to long-term storage solutions, like remote storage backends (e.g., Thanos or Cortex).

3. **Data Compression**:
   - Prometheus uses efficient storage techniques such as **chunked storage** and **delta encoding** to reduce disk usage.

4. **Labeling System**:
   - Metrics are identified using **labels** in addition to metric names.
   - Example:
     ```promql
     http_requests_total{method="GET", status="200"}
     ```
   - Labels allow fine-grained filtering and aggregation.

5. **Querying with PromQL**:
   - Users query metrics using PromQL, which provides powerful aggregation, slicing, and dicing capabilities.
   - For example:
     - **Sum of All Requests**: `sum(http_requests_total)`
     - **Requests Per Second**: `rate(http_requests_total[1m])`

6. **Alerting**:
   - Alerts are defined in **alerting rules**.
   - Prometheus evaluates these rules at regular intervals and sends alerts to Alertmanager.
   - Example Rule:
     ```yaml
     - alert: HighCPUUsage
       expr: node_cpu_usage_seconds_total > 0.9
       for: 1m
       labels:
         severity: critical
       annotations:
         summary: "High CPU usage detected"
     ```

7. **Scaling**:
   - Prometheus can run independently but may face scaling challenges in large environments.
   - To scale:
     - Use **federation** to aggregate data from multiple Prometheus instances.
     - Integrate with long-term storage systems like Thanos or Cortex for horizontal scalability.

### **Flow of Operations**:
1. The **Prometheus server** scrapes metrics from configured targets at specified intervals.
2. Metrics are ingested into the **time-series database**.
3. Users query the data using **PromQL** to perform aggregations and visualize it.
4. If an alert condition is met, the **Alertmanager** processes and sends notifications.

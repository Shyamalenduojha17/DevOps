### **Prometheus Architecture**
Prometheus consists of multiple components that work together to provide metrics collection, storage, and query capabilities. Here are its key components:

1. **Prometheus Server**:
   - **Core Component**: Responsible for scraping and storing metrics.
   - **Functions**:
     - Fetches metrics by querying configured targets via HTTP endpoints (using the pull model).
     - Stores the scraped metrics in a time-series database.
     - Handles queries from users via PromQL (Prometheus Query Language).

2. **Pushgateway**:
   - Used for services that cannot be scraped directly.
   - Acts as an intermediary where applications can push metrics, which Prometheus then pulls.

3. **Alertmanager**:
   - Handles alerts generated by Prometheus based on preconfigured rules.
   - Supports deduplication, grouping, routing, and notification through various channels like email, Slack, or PagerDuty.

4. **Exporters**:
   - Standalone services that expose metrics in a format Prometheus can scrape.
   - Examples include **Node Exporter** (system metrics), **Blackbox Exporter** (endpoint testing), and application-specific exporters like for databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

5. **PromQL**:
   - A query language specifically designed to query and aggregate metrics stored in Prometheus.
   - Example:
     ```promql
     rate(http_requests_total[5m])
     ```

6. **Storage**:
   - Stores metrics as time-series data (a combination of metric name, timestamp, and value).
   - Data is stored in a highly efficient custom database format optimized for time-series data.

7. **Service Discovery**:
   - Automatically discovers targets to monitor.
   - Supports static configurations as well as dynamic discovery using integrations with platforms like Kubernetes, AWS, GCP, and Consul.

8. **Visualization**:
   - Exposes metrics via a built-in web interface.
   - Often used in conjunction with Grafana for advanced visualization and dashboarding.

### **How Prometheus Works Internally**

1. **Metric Scraping (Pull Model)**:
   - Prometheus periodically scrapes metrics from configured targets via HTTP.
   - Targets expose metrics in a standard format at an endpoint (usually `/metrics`).

2. **Time-Series Data Storage**:
   - Metrics are stored as time-series (a series of timestamped values per metric).
   - Prometheus uses a local storage engine (based on **levelDB** or **TSDB**) to manage this data efficiently.
   - Older metrics can be archived to long-term storage solutions, like remote storage backends (e.g., Thanos or Cortex).

3. **Data Compression**:
   - Prometheus uses efficient storage techniques such as **chunked storage** and **delta encoding** to reduce disk usage.

4. **Labeling System**:
   - Metrics are identified using **labels** in addition to metric names.
   - Example:
     ```promql
     http_requests_total{method="GET", status="200"}
     ```
   - Labels allow fine-grained filtering and aggregation.

5. **Querying with PromQL**:
   - Users query metrics using PromQL, which provides powerful aggregation, slicing, and dicing capabilities.
   - For example:
     - **Sum of All Requests**: `sum(http_requests_total)`
     - **Requests Per Second**: `rate(http_requests_total[1m])`

6. **Alerting**:
   - Alerts are defined in **alerting rules**.
   - Prometheus evaluates these rules at regular intervals and sends alerts to Alertmanager.
   - Example Rule:
     ```yaml
     - alert: HighCPUUsage
       expr: node_cpu_usage_seconds_total > 0.9
       for: 1m
       labels:
         severity: critical
       annotations:
         summary: "High CPU usage detected"
     ```

7. **Scaling**:
   - Prometheus can run independently but may face scaling challenges in large environments.
   - To scale:
     - Use **federation** to aggregate data from multiple Prometheus instances.
     - Integrate with long-term storage systems like Thanos or Cortex for horizontal scalability.

---

### **Flow of Operations**:
1. The **Prometheus server** scrapes metrics from configured targets at specified intervals.
2. Metrics are ingested into the **time-series database**.
3. Users query the data using **PromQL** to perform aggregations and visualize it.
4. If an alert condition is met, the **Alertmanager** processes and sends notifications.

### Types of Exporter ###

In **Prometheus**, **exporters** are crucial for collecting and exposing metrics from various systems, applications, and services. They act as bridges between Prometheus and monitored components, providing metrics in a format Prometheus understands. Below are the main types of exporters commonly used:

---

### **1. Node Exporter**
- **Purpose**: Collects hardware and OS-level metrics from Linux/Unix systems.
- **Common Metrics**:
  - CPU usage
  - Memory usage
  - Disk I/O
  - Filesystem usage
  - Network statistics
- **Use Case**: Monitoring server performance and system health.

---

### **2. Blackbox Exporter**
- **Purpose**: Tests endpoints via HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, ICMP (ping), and TCP protocols to monitor their availability and response time.
- **Common Metrics**:
  - HTTP response codes
  - Latency (response time)
  - Connectivity (reachability of services)
- **Use Case**: Monitoring the health of public or internal APIs, websites, and other endpoints.

---

### **3. Database Exporters**
Exporters for various databases expose database performance and usage metrics:
- **MySQL Exporter**:
  - Metrics: Query performance, connection counts, slow queries, etc.
- **PostgreSQL Exporter**:
  - Metrics: Active connections, query performance, buffer stats, etc.
- **MongoDB Exporter**:
  - Metrics: Memory usage, connection counts, cache usage, etc.
- **ElasticSearch Exporter**:
  - Metrics: Indexing rate, search query latency, cluster health, etc.

---

### **4. Cloud-Specific Exporters**
These exporters are designed to collect metrics from cloud services:
- **AWS CloudWatch Exporter**:
  - Pulls metrics from AWS CloudWatch (e.g., EC2, RDS, Lambda metrics).
- **Azure Monitor Exporter**:
  - Collects metrics from Azure Monitor and related services.
- **GCP Exporter**:
  - Integrates with Google Cloud Monitoring (formerly Stackdriver).

---

### **5. Application-Specific Exporters**
Exporters tailored for specific applications:
- **Kafka Exporter**:
  - Metrics: Broker stats, consumer group offsets, partitions, etc.
- **Redis Exporter**:
  - Metrics: Memory usage, keyspace stats, eviction counts, etc.
- **Nginx Exporter**:
  - Metrics: Requests, connections, response times, etc.

---

### **6. Storage and Filesystem Exporters**
- **Ceph Exporter**:
  - Monitors distributed storage systems.
- **GlusterFS Exporter**:
  - Tracks performance and health of GlusterFS storage clusters.

---

### **7. Message Broker Exporters**
- **RabbitMQ Exporter**:
  - Metrics: Queue lengths, message rates, consumers, etc.
- **ActiveMQ Exporter**:
  - Metrics: Queue status, message processing, etc.

---

### **8. Kubernetes Exporters**
- **Kube-State-Metrics**:
  - Exposes Kubernetes objects' states (e.g., Pods, Deployments, Services).
- **cAdvisor**:
  - Monitors container metrics such as resource usage (CPU, memory).
- **Kubernetes API Server Exporter**:
  - Provides metrics about Kubernetes cluster API operations.

---

### **9. Exporters for Network Devices**
- **SNMP Exporter**:
  - Collects metrics from network devices via SNMP (routers, switches).
- **IPMI Exporter**:
  - Monitors hardware metrics (e.g., temperature, fan speed) using IPMI.

---

### **10. JMX Exporter**
- **Purpose**: Collects metrics from Java applications via the JMX protocol.
- **Use Case**: Monitor Java-based services like Kafka, Tomcat, and Cassandra.

---

### **11. Custom Exporters**
- You can write your own exporters for specialized applications or services that do not have pre-built exporters. This involves exposing metrics in the **Prometheus text-based format**.

---

### **Which Exporter to Use?**
- **System Monitoring**: Use the **Node Exporter**.
- **Cloud Services**: AWS, Azure, or GCP exporters.
- **Kubernetes**: Combine **kube-state-metrics**, **cAdvisor**, and others.
- **Custom Applications**: Use the **JMX Exporter** for Java apps or write a custom one.

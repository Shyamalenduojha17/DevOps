ðŸ”¹ Intermediate to Advanced (Scenario-Based)

11.	You notice that Prometheus is missing metrics from some services. How would you troubleshoot the issue?
12.	You need to monitor custom business metrics from your application. How would you expose these metrics to Prometheus?
13.	Prometheus is consuming too much memory over time. How would you investigate and optimize it?
14.	You want to set up alerts for high CPU usage on your nodes. How would you implement this using Prometheus and Alertmanager?
15.	You need to visualize Prometheus metrics in dashboards. What tools would you use and how would you integrate them?
16.	You want to monitor a dynamic set of services in Kubernetes with Prometheus. How would you configure service discovery?
17.	You want to keep Prometheus metrics for more than 15 days. How would you configure long-term storage?
18.	You are using Prometheus in a microservices environment and notice label cardinality explosion. How would you handle it?
19.	Your Alertmanager is sending too many notifications due to flapping alerts. How would you reduce noise without losing visibility?
20.	You are setting up high availability for Prometheus. What are your options, and how would you implement them?
